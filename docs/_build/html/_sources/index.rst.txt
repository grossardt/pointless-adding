Overview
==============

**Pointless Adding** is a nonsensical dummy repository to test certain practises
for development of more complex Python packages.

It contains the subpackages:

- `pointless_adding.objects` containing "Objects" that can be "added" together
- `pointless_adding.adders` containing the "Adders" that perform the addition
